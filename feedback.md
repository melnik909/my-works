"I'm glad you post about UX and accessibility. Many developers think it's not needed, but a lot of the small ways we can improve their experience comes from the ways developers implement designs.
I'm not sure how we got connected, but I've enjoyed your posts. I would love to stay in touch as well!"

 "I personally came for accessibility, since i feel like there are not enough *good* content about this topic. Everyone just ignore or try to automate it instead of just diving into it. 
But I also like the css part, I guess it attracts wider audience. You are the only content creator i know who actually talks about such an important topic"
